### Installation
Please ensure the following packages are available along with Anaconda distribution of Python.
1. Matplotlib
2. Seaborn
3. PySpark

### Project Details
The objective of this project is to explore the Sparkify dataset provided and leverage what has been learnt through the Data Scientist course to predict a customer churn by 
the following steps.
1. Analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have an understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.
2. Implement the algorithms and metrics of the chosen models, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way.
3. Gather the results about my findings, and make my concluding remarks about whether the implementation adequately solves the problem.
4. Construct a blog post (or other medium for a write-up) to document all of the steps from start to finish

### File Description
There is one notebook file (attached here) to showcase my work related to the project objective. The notebook is self-explanatory and has Markdown cells & comments to assist in understanding each and every step.

### Results
Details about my findings and results can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sridhar.1983/user-churn-prediction-using-pyspark-4e14c78720be).
