# 1. Installation

In addition to the Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3.5+, please install the following packages:
NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
PySpark

# 2. Project Description:

In this project, the objective is to make use of the distributed computing nature of Spark to explore and understand the Sparkify dataset provided, and use machine learning APIs from Spark ML to build and tune models to predict the churn rate of Sparkify. Sparkify is a music streaming service and the dataset used in this project is mainly activity logs from each user which would be useful for predicting the churn rate.

# 3. File Description

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase the work done in this project. The notebook is self explanatory and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# 4. Results

The main findings and research for this project can be found in the post available in the link below.

# 5. Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements

I must give credit to Udacity for the data provided as part of this nanodegree program.
